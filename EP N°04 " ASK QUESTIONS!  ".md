the degree to which u believe that something is true , if u care abt critical thinking & science , literacy , that degree should be in proprtion to the evidence that supports it .


SKEPTICISM is u have reason to think that the person is saying might be not true so u inquire further.


SKEPTICISM is not outright rejection of what u dont want to be true , its the rejection of what u dont think is true .


A PRORER SKEPTIC questions what theyre unsure of , but recognizes when valid evidence is presented to change their mind , its a path of inquiry towards the truth and u have to know what it means to receive information that is true and accurate to inform ur SKEPTICISM .


Whatever it is u think is true want to be true , find another way to demonstrate that , than by your testimony , its an odd thing , how high eyewitness testimony is in the court of law , because in the court of science , it is the very lowest form of testimony .
