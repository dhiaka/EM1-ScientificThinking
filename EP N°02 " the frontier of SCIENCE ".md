the frontier of discovery its a messy place, sometimes u dont even know what question to ask its like ur in a forest , and ur asking where is the edge of this forest " idk " and then u get to the edge of the forest , and u peer out in into this unknown frontier .


u dont even know what questions to ask necessarily , maybe u think what question to ask and its the wrong question , maybe one day we will know everything and as the area of knowledge grows there is a less and a  less to explore and yet we make mistakes there .


the day u stop making mistakes is the day u can be pretty sure u no longer on the frontier


science is when u have such deep understanding of whats going on , u can make a prediction of something that has never happened before .


so science at its best is not the prediciton of the reccuring of a reccuring event its having such a deep understanding of what things work on that u can predict an outcome of what somebody is doing or is about to do without ever seen that experiment performed before 


they are called THEORIES :

- the theory of evolution , CHARLES DARWIN 1859

- the theroy of relativity 

- the theory of quantum 1920 it means the understanding of particles , not only sub molecular particles , molecules , atoms and what s smaller than atoms , you .


so a THEORY is the hightest level of understanding we have of anything in this world that is a theory , so uf u have an idea about something that is untested and u dont know about it yet , its ur hypothesis its eistein's THEROY of relativity .
