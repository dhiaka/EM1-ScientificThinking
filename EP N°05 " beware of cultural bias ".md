its not our fault that were human , being human , we all have susceptibility to a certain category of bias , & its called cognitive bias, these are things u think are true but are not and can be demonstrated to not be true ; you're staring at it bare faced , and u say : u swear to u this is how it is AND ITS NOT .


there are all manner of cognitive biases , there are some tat particularly insidious if you're trying to understand what is objectively true .4


if there's ever a moment where something happens around u and you want to think its special , just pause because chances are it's not , and this comes about because this human brain is not wired to think about probability and statistics .


the cosmic perspective : COSMIC PERSPECTIVE teaches you that you are special ,  not for being different from everyone else but for being the same .


a cosmic perspective has the power to reset what it is you think is important in life has a power to humble you but in a good way , has the power to have you recongnize that the ego you had carried with you throughout life is injustified in the grandest scheme of things.

<=> THAT IS A COSMIC PERSPECTIVE .


search engines on the internet are epitome of confirmation bias , there is no greater force in the universe than an internet search in the world of confirmation bias .


" i was asked ?! they said , what books are you reading this week because im an author and they like knowing  what other authors are read by the authors and they ask , so i listed the books and they said , WOW i didn't expect that , I said what do you mean you didn't expect it ? well , none of those books are anything you ever talk about or that you would believe in , i was reading a book on ASTROLOGY , I had a KING JAMES BIBLE that i was reading , i had a book on UFOs ; i was reading all these books , why are you reading those books , you don't believe , i said i'm reading them because these are thoughts that other people are having , i want to know what those thoughts are . "



if u only watch TV , search internet and read books that agrees with what you think then you have constructed a box , and each of other items , each of those forces operate on you is a brick in that box you have boxed yourself in YOU ARE IN A BUBBLE
