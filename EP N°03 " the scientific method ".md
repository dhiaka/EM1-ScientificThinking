THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD is do whatever it takes to not fool yourself into thinking that something is true or not or into thinking that something is true that is ;
THATS THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD WHATEVER IT TAKES .


& that PATHWAY is not straight , its CURVED ! it has off-ramps that lead nowhere and u dont even know of the paths that lay in front of u , which ine is gonna get in to the right place .


NATURE is the ultimate judge , jury and executioner , u can argue all u want but nature doesent agree with u , youre wrong .


either we found the limits of the applacability of NEWTON'S laws.


NEWTON'S laws only work on so far away from the sun , maybe u go too far awat , they break down ; THATS A POSSIBILY , no one had ever tested NEWTON'S laws that far out so thats one possibily .


three cases where theree planets are not moving away we thought they were 
- one was a triumph pf NEWTON'S laws.
- one discovered a failure of NEWTON'S laws and needed new physics to understand it 
- and the third were faulty obserations


there is nothing malcious inthose abd mesasurements , youre at the telescope , u think but thats the beauty of science , one result is not the answer , u need corroboration from different experiments , different inverstigators , and out that comes the objective truths ,that shape of understanding of the universe .
