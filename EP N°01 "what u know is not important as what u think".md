here we are in earth, we are participant in an ecosystem.
i belong to something bigger than my daily routine.
u are not seperate and distinct from the universe ?! because u are part of the universe, u are in the universe The universe is in you.
science literacy is not so much about what u know but about how ur brain us wired for thought, how ur brain is wired to ask questions .
empowering u to probe knowledge & information thats out there in the quest for what is objectively true in this world .
challenges , problems , that face u , your family , society and the  world .


so what  im going to  share with u is the methods and tools of science that enable us to go from ignorance of whar us going on to an understanding of what is going on , and ultimaletly leading to an established objective trut, to not only find objective truths.
but then communicate to others is how to get there.


communication is the half of the work, knowing how to do it thats the first half, doing it thats the second half u have to start asking questions of everything .


so that by the end of every day , u are closer to some truth that u previously , u either didnt even know was there or thought was something different.


im empowered to think for myself , not to have someone else tell me what is true because i figured out what was true .


if u want to communicate better
if u care abt what is actually true in the world
if u care abt being empowered by science literacy 
<=> then follow me im DHIA and ima show u some readings sheets in pastebin to read it and to begin a empowered figure in this weird world !
